<h1>Contractors</h1>

<p>Recently, my wife and I decided to get our basement finished.  We decided that it was time we made some improvements to our house.  We figured that since the budget was there, let's spend it while there's a surplus.</p>

<p>So, we did our due diligence and looked high and low for a respectable contractor.  We compared prices, skills, and personalities.  We networked with people we knew that had similar work done to make an educated decision.  This was an important task to us because it involved such a major part of our daily lives and we couldn't trust a project with such high expectations to just any one. </p>

<p>We finally found our guy and we were ecstatic.  After all of our research, we decided that we wanted quality over price.  This finished basement would be around for the foreseeable future so we wanted this done right and we wanted it done effectively.  We were willing to sacrifice a little cash for realizing that such a task would be in entrusted hands.</p>
<p>
So, on the day our beloved contractor arrived at our house, I decided I would present him with a few terms and conditions that would govern our arrangement.  It was standard procedure for me with hired specialists like painters, gardeners, or electricians.  It mainly centered around the tools that would be used on the job.  </p>

<p>In an effort to enlighten the populace, I figured I'd share this small contract just in case it could help those of you out there looking to get the same semblance of work done.</p>

<h3>TOOLS</h3>

<ul>
<li> Please do not bring your own tools to this job.  I have purchased a set of tools that I feel should be adequate for you based on my experiences and judgment.  The only problem is, I bought the tools 25 years ago.  They worked fine for me in 1989, though, so there's no reason these same tools shouldn't be fine for what I think you'll have to do.</li><br>

<li> The only slight issue with these tools is that I ship them off to a 'tool support' company after each contractor leaves.  The tool support company cleans the tools, removing any dirt or residue left over by the previous worker.  They return them to me almost as good as new.  By almost, I mean that I've been doing this for the last 25 years, so there's bound to be a bit of decay after each cleaning.  It takes about two weeks for me to ship the tools off and get them back, though.  At current time, they are still in transit.  </li><br>

<li>I was absolutely aware the tools would not be here for you before you arrived, but I figured since you were starting today, you could read up on some documentation regarding my home, its basic layout and the hierarchical reporting structure of my family.  I'd also like you to remember our policies and procedures for you to follow concerning the location of any periphery that you may need such as printers, cables, etc, where our restroom facilities are, and what we expect out of contractors we’ve selected to work for us.  It also contains a host of documentation surrounding how I feel basements should be finished.  Full disclosure:  I've never actually finished a basement, but I have lived in neighborhoods where basements were reportedly finished.  I’d like to impart some of the wisdom I've collected in that time.  </li>

		<p>I understand you will only be here for a limited time, but it's very important to me that you remember where our outlets are long after you've gone.</p>

		<li>Some tools will require being plugged into an electrical outlet.  Yes, I am aware that most electric tools now operate cordlessly, but they did not in 1989.  These were top of the line then and yes, while they have fallen from favor in recent years, I'm sure you will have no problem.  </li>

		<p>Regardless, the cordless tools will not operate in my basement anyway.  The original construction was built from a space-age polymer that seems to render any battery-powered tools useless in my basement.  I do apologize for this, but there will two (2) 5 feet extension cords provided to you for use in the one (1) electrical outlet in the cellar.</p>

		<li>I require you to secure the tools at all times when not using them.  You may bring them home with you each night (a preferred approach in case I need you to respond to a construction emergency off-hours) or you may lock them up here in my basement.  I will be providing you with an imitation leather sack to carry the tools whether you need one or not, so you may use that to carry them home if you so choose.  If the tools are remaining on my premises, though, they must be secured at all times.  I cannot guarantee who will be in my house at any given time of the day.  If the tools are stolen, you will be held solely responsible.</li></br>

			<li>While most tools have various speeds, there are only a choice few on each of them that will be accessible to you.  Because even though I have taken great precaution already to protect my investment AND have made what I feel is a very prudent decision on hiring you, I simply cannot trust you with anything.  </li>

				<p>I have rewired each of them to prompt you for a privileged user's password if you need to increase speed, RPMs, voltage, etc.  You may request me to log in for you, but you will have to provide me justification on why you need this extra setting.  You will then be notified in two (2) weeks whether you were approved.  I cannot guarantee you will get approval though and if not, you will not be able to use those settings.</p>

				<li>There will come a time when you need a tool that I simply cannot provide.  The occasional auger or sander will be required at some point.  When this situation arises, you will need to provide me a with a handwritten document containing the  tool make and model and no more than ten (10)) reasons why this tool will assist you in your daily job.  </li>

					<p>In the event I cannot or will not procure this necessary tool, you will either have to press on without it or you can choose from a list of tools that I have pre-approved for ordering, but for some reason, have not given you.  Some of these tools may be reasonable facsimiles of the tool you need, while others will be wildly off base.  I would urge you to try similar tools though, because you never know, you just may find removing screws works better with the claw end of a hammer.  Always keep an open mind. </p>


					<li>The good news though is that some of the tools you are using are nearing their end of life (manufacturer's extended warranty).  As such, I will be purchasing new ones to replace the old ones as they come off warranty.  There is a set of 10 year old tools on eBay that I have had my eye on.  If a new(er) tool is purchased, the process repeats over again, starting with a two (2) week wait.</li>
					</ul>

And finally, I know you mentioned standard time to finish a basement of this size is one month based on past experiences, but again, I have experience being acquaintances with people who have had their basements finished, so I know best how much time this should take.  I need this done in six (6) days.</p><br>
